# Ghibli-Style Image Generator 🎨✨
This project is an AI-powered image-to-image converter that transforms uploaded images into Studio Ghibli-style artwork using Stable Diffusion. It utilizes the StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline from Hugging Face's diffusers library to apply soft painterly brushstrokes, warm colors, and a magical atmosphere inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's iconic animation style.

# Features
